## Features

This is the initial version, so there aren't many features yet, but we do have:

* Support for installing the Habitat command-line tool
* Terminal integration for entering the Habitat Studio, running builds, etc.
* Syntax highlighing and code snippets for plan files, hooks, helpers, and more
* Command-palette support for package search, opening docs, and opening Builder
* Much more to come! ([Make a suggestion here](https://github.com/cnunciato/vscode-habitat/issues)!)

## Issues? Suggestions?

As I said, this is the first cut, so expect a few rough edges. If you run into
any problems, or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know by
[submitting a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cnunciato/vscode-habitat/issues).
Contributions welcome.
