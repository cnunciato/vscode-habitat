# Habitat

A Visual Studio Code extension for working with [Habitat](https://habitat.sh).

## Features

This is the initial version, so there aren't too many features yet, but there are a few:

* Support for installing the Habitat command-line tool
* Terminal integration for entering the Habitat Studio, running builds, etc.
* Syntax highlighing and code snippets for plan files, hooks, helpers, and more
* Command-palette support for package search, opening docs, and opening Builder
* Much more to come!

## Known Issues

As I said, this is the first cut, so there are still a few rough edges. If you run into
any issues, please submit them for us, and we'll tackle them as quickly as we can.

Thanks for using Habitat! We hope you have fun.
